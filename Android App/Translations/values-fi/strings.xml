    <string name="disclaimer_message">By continuing to the download and in using the Trans Euro Trail® files, you are accepting and agree to everything below.
\n\n
1. The GPX is issued by the Trans Euro Trail® Community Interest Company, Company No. 11371199, Address: Unit 3, Cragg Road, Mytholmroyd, Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, HX7 5HR, United Kingdom.
\n\n
2. The GPX is issued free of charge and is provided "as is," with all faults, defects and errors, and without warranty of any kind.
\n\n
3. The accuracy of the trail is not guaranteed, nor are the GPS co-ordinates.
\n\n
4. The Trans Euro Trail® is a suggestion not a direction.
\n\n
5. The Trans Euro Trail® Community Interest Company does not represent or warrant that materials in the site or the services are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.
\n\n
6. The Trans Euro Trail® Community Interest Company cannot represent or warrant that the site or its servers are free of viruses or other harmful components.
\n\n
7. You undertake not to share this GPX on any electronic file sharing device or server.
\n\n
8. You will download the most recent GPX for your country of travel just before you require it and download updates, if relevant, while travelling.
\n\n
9. If you stray onto private land, apologise and get back onto the road or trail.
\n\n
10. These trails can be temporarily or permanently closed at short notice under local law.
\n\n
11. Do not ride trails beyond your capability. If unsure, get off your bike and walk the trail first. Be prepared to turn round and find an alternative route.
\n\n
12. Trail riding alone, especially on trails you do not know, is really unwise.
\n\n
13. Many country trails are rarely maintained. You will find ruts, holes, floods, treacherous surfaces and the occasional booby trap hazard deliberately placed by people who do not like motorcycles using trails.
\n\n
14. When you use the trails and roads, you are on your own. You exercise your judgement in your own skills and your own navigation. All the Trans Euro Trail® Community Interest Company can do is show you where some of the trails are, but their legality and viability are not confirmed and can change at a moment\'s notice.
\n\n
15. You undertake to respect and adhere to road signs, barriers and local laws. The decision to use a road or trail is entirely yours and you accept that you bear full responsibility for your action or any infringements of the law.
\n\n
16. The Trans Euro Trail® Community Interest Company shall not have any liability for use of the GPX, directly or indirectly arising out of its use or in any way involving any Claim which is brought in any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, Isle of Man or Channel Islands.
\n\n
17. Motorcycling carries risks. Adventure motorcycling adds to these:\n
a. Mobile phone coverage may be patchy or non-existent so summoning help may be limited. If help is summoned it may struggle to reach you and you may incur high costs. Unpaved tracks vary from gravel to broken tar to sand to stone to boulder to grass. Each carries its own challenges of grip, stability and unpredictability all of which vary immensely with weather conditions which can change quickly especially in mountain areas.\n
b. The physical demands of riding a motorcycle, laden or otherwise, off road are not to be underestimated. If you drop it, picking it up can be hard work and recovering it from a hillside, river or mud hole where it has slipped can be exhausting. Add into the mix the variable climate in Europe - subzero to high 30s and above - and heat, cold and dehydration can impair performance and make a dangerous cocktail when mixed with the complex task of off pavement riding.\n
c. Navigation can be challenging, especially without practicing using GPS or maps on the move, on the “wrong" side of the road or with signposts in an unfamiliar script.\n
d. Mechanical issues easily sorted out in one's own garage or home city can become much more of a challenge away from home in an area with poor infrastructure or dealer knowledge. \n
e. Local adults and children (and animals!) may be unfamiliar with motorcycles or their capabilities and misjudge situations. Driving standards and discipline vary hugely and often the perception is “might is right” with scant regard being paid to the little guy on a motorbike. \n
f. Local wildlife both domestic and wild can pose risks. Bears and wolves are present in some areas, snakes in others, wild roaming reindeer in the far north and cattle and dogs are all over. \n
g. Laws and regulations are always changing across the continent, so a trail that contributors thought was legal, may not now be so. This may lead to conflict with the authorities, communities, landowners or other users - anything from a glance, a shout or a waved fist to arrest, prosecution, litigation, bike confiscation, fine or loss of licence or liberty.\n
h. Concepts and practice of sanitation and hygiene vary immensely and medical facilities can be scarce, suboptimal or distant.\n
i. The seedier side of humanity can also impact on you through theft, assault or fraud.\n
j. Be aware that some areas of eastern Europe also have heightened awareness of mobile populations following the influx of refugees so you may come across desperately poor people or wary authorities.\n
k. In Bosnia, Croatia and other locations the detritus of war still exists in the form of uncleared mine-fields. Snow, water and soil creep all shift these so that straying from established well used trails can be dangerous and, needless to say, stupid.
\n\n
18. All trails and roads require you and your motorcycle to be fully insured, licensed and road-worthy.
\n\n
19. You should ensure that your paperwork is in order whether it be bike, breakdown or medical/repatriation insurance, licences or passports.
\n\n
20. You should get some practice in to build confidence and competence (and respect for your own limits and those of your bike).
\n\n
21. You should ensure you are properly equipped with the right tyres, spares, protection, first aid kit, communications devices (and batteries!), luggage and camping gear.
\n\n
22. Ride with an awareness of the terrain, surface and in anticipation of unexpected hazards.
\n\n
23. Moderate your speed.
\n\n
24. Get bike fit. If you’ve got a medical condition then think carefully and take some medical advice.
\n\n
25. Start the trip with a travel ready bike. Get familiar with your bike, what daily checks to make and how to fix issues with it.
\n\n
26. Take security precautions with your possessions and self.
\n\n
27. You agree to adhere to the Trans Euro Trail® Code of Conduct and be an ambassador of responsible motorcycling.
\n\n
28. Accept that you are master or mistress of your own destiny, safety, health and security. You take responsibility for whatever happens.</string>
